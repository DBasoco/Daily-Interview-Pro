# Daily-Interview-Pro
This is where I will tackle simple coding interview problems. I will give myself only 30 minutes before I post whatever I have accomplished. This way I can demonstrate my problem sovling skills while under the pressure of a time line.

Some of them I may be unable to solve, but I will annotate and show my thought process on each of problem.
